## Man and His Symbols by Carl Gustav Jung - [livro digital](https://kindle.amazon.com/work/man-symbols-carl-gustav-jung-ebook/B000AIBU7E/B006V3E2MC)

To Jungians the dream is not a kind of standardized cryptogram that can be decoded by a glossary of symbol meanings. It is an integral, important, and personal expression of the individual unconscious. It is just as “real” as any other phenomenon attaching to the individual.

Because there are innumerable things beyond the range of human understanding, we constantly use symbolic terms to represent concepts that we cannot define or fully comprehend. This is one reason why all religions employ symbolic language or images. But this conscious use of symbols is only one aspect of a psychological fact of great importance: Man also produces symbols unconsciously and spontaneously, in the form of dreams.

Mandala is a Sanskrit term that is believed to translate to “circle” in English. Used as an aid to meditation, mandalas are thought to originate in conjunction with ancient Indian beliefs concerning the importance of the center as a sacred space from which a cosmic power can enter a figure. Mandalas have historically been used by Hindus and Buddhists as aids for meditation, although the mandala has taken many forms throughout history. It is associated with many cultures and is a part of various religions, from ancient times to the present.

The circle is one of the most immediately recognizable shapes in the universe and was recognized by medieval scholars as a divine or perfect shape. It is the basis of so many structures in the universe, from atoms and cells through stars and galaxies. It promotes relaxation because there are no boundaries, it is the most symmetrical two dimensional shape in existence, and unlike squares or rectangles, the circle can be rotated in any direction and remains the same. The circle does not have distracting corners or complex points so it is easy to focus on the center.

Carl Jung, the father of analytical psychology, found that mandalas can be products of the unconscious. They are irrational and almost magical in nature, and, in his book Memories, Dreams and Reflections, Jung described the mandala as “the exponent of all paths. It is the path to the center, of individuation” (Jung and Jaffe 1962). As a natural part of the universe, the mandala symbol is also a natural part of each person’s psyche.

Kellogg pioneered research in the use of mandalas in art therapy. She developed her theory based on recurring design schemas while, “collecting, observing and classifying thousands of patients’ mandala drawings” during the 1970s (Cox 2003). To support her research she standardized the materials and instructions offered to clients attending the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center. Each client used a 36 or 48 set of oil pastels and drawing paper with a pre-drawn mandala centered on it. They were instructed to work in an open, meditative manner, allowing images, shapes, or patterns to emerge intuitively.

### Definição de círculo

Segundo símbolo fundamental (de acordo com CHAS, 24), no grupo a que pertecem o centro, a cruz e o quadrado.
Em primeiro lugar, o círculo é um ponto estendido; participa da perfeição do ponto. Por conseguinte, o ponto e o círculo, possuem propriedades simbólicas comuns: perfeição, homogeneirdade, ausência de distinção ou divisão... O movimento circular é perfeito, imutável, sem começo nem fim, e nem variações; o que habilita a simbolizar o tempo. Define-se o tempo como uma sucessão contínua e aos outros.... O círculo simbolizará também o céu, de movimento circular inalterável.

A forma primordial é, efetivamente, menos o círculo do que a esfera, representação do mundo. Todavia o círculo é a taça, ou a projeção desta esfera. Por isso o paraíso terrestre era círcular.  A passagem do quadrado do círculo -- na mandala, por exemplo, é da cristalização espacial ao nirvana, à indeterminação original; passagem da Terra ao Céu, segundo a terminologia chinesa. O que confirma a simbólica ocidental e cristã.

### Definição de mandala

A mandala é literalmente um círculo, ainda que seu desenho seja complexo e muitas vezes se encerre em uma moldura quadrata. Como o *iantra* (de uso emblemático), mas de modo menos esquemático, a mandala é ao mesmo tempo um resumo da manifestação espacial, uma imagem do mundo, além de ser a representação de a atualiação de porências dividas; é assim uma imagem psicagógica, propria para conduzir que contempla à iluminação.

Na tradição tibetana, o mandala é o guia imaginário e provisório da meditação. Ele manifesta em suas combinações variadas de círculos e de quadrados o universo espiritual e o material assim como a dinâmica das relações que os unem, no plano tríplice, cósmico, antropológico e divino.

C.G. Jung recorre à imagem do mandala para designar uma _ representação simbólica da psique, cuja essência nos é desconhecida._ Ele observou, assim como seus discípulos, que essas imagens são utilizadas para _consolidar o ser interior ou para favorecer a meditação em profundidade. A comtemplação de um mandala supostamente inspira a serenidade, o sentimento de que a vida reencontrou seu sentido e sua ordem. O mandala produz o mesmo efeito quando aparece espontaneamente nos sonhos do homem moderno que ignora essas tradições religiosas. As formas redondas do mandala simbolizam em geral a integridade natural, enquanto a forma quadrangular representa a tomada de consciência iminente do centro._. O mandala possui uma eficácia dupla: conservar a ordem psíquica, se ela existe; restabelecê-la se desapareceu. Nesse caso, exerce uma função estimulante e criadora (JUNS, 213-215,227)

Aplicando à terapêutica ocupacional as descobertas de Jung abrem-se novas perspectivas para este método. O exercício de atividades poderá enriquecer-se de importante significação. Compreender-se-à o valor terapêutico  que irá adquirir, na esquisofrenia, a proposta, ao doente, de atividades já vivenciadas e utilizadas pelo homem primitivo para exprimir suas violentas emoções.

Em vez dos impulsos arcaicos exeteriorizarem desabridamente, lhe oferecemos o declive que a espécie humana sulcou durante milênios para exprimi-los: dança, representações mímicas, pintura, modelagem, música. Será o mais simples e o mais eficaz.
